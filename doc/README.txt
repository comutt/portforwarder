------------------------------------------------------------
* How to install
    + Create a new folder and put PortForwarder.exe into it.
      That's all.

------------------------------------------------------------
* How to use
    + Create your own config file.  You may copy and edit
      config_sample.txt.

    + Put you own config file into any folder you like.  I
      always put config.txt (my config file) into the same
      folder as PortForwarder.exe.

    + Start PortForwarder.

    + Select your config file by clicking the "..." button.

    + Select "Host".  The combo box should contain your
      hosts in your config file.

    + Click "Connect".  Put password in the dialog if asked.

    + When "Status" changes to "Connected", all is ready!

    + Click "Exit" when you want to disconnect.

  See http://www.fuji-climb.org/howtouse.html for details.

------------------------------------------------------------
* How to uninstall
    + Remove all the files you don't need any more.
      Probably PortForwarder.exe, PortForwarder.ini and
      known_hosts.  Maybe your config file and keys, too.
      You don't have to worry about registry because
      PortForwarder doesn't touch it at all!
